## Position Summary
This role will oversee operation and maintenance of electron-beam evaporators and other physical vapor deposition (PVD) tools used for thin-film metal and dielectric deposition.

## Key Responsibilities
1. Operate and maintain e-beam evaporators (multi-pocket, load-locked systems).
2. Develop thin-film processes for materials such as Ni, Cr, Au, Pt, etc.
3. Characterize film thickness, adhesion, step coverage, and purity.
4. Handle target material loading, chamber cleaning, and vacuum maintenance.
5. Monitor and maintain tool calibration (crystal monitor, deposition rate).
6. Manage material inventory (pellets, crucibles, wafers).
7. Write and maintain SOPs, safety documentation, and maintenance logs.
8. Train users and support process integration for superconducting and neural probe devices.

## Required Qualifications
1. Bachelor's degree or higher in Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Physics, Mechanical Engineering, or a closely related field.
2. At least 2 years of hands-on experience operating and maintaining PVD systems (especially e-beam evaporators), plasma ashers, and surface metrology tools such as profilometers.
3. Strong understanding of vacuum technology, thin-film deposition principles, and film characterization techniques.
4. Familiarity with cleanroom safety protocols and standard micro/nanofabrication workflows.
5. Excellent documentation and troubleshooting skills, particularly in writing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and maintenance logs.
6. Ability to work both independently and as part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary team.
7. Fluency in English&Chinese, with the ability to communicate effectively in an international working environment.

## Preferred Qualifications
1. Master's or Ph.D. in a relevant technical field.
2. Previous work in a university shared facility, semiconductor fab, or national lab setting.
