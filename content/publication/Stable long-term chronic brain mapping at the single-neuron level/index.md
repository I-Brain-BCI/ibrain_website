abstract: This work demonstrates stable, long-term chronic brain mapping at the single-neuron level using syringe-injectable mesh electronics. The research presents a revolutionary approach for integrating flexible electronics directly into brain tissue, enabling continuous monitoring of individual neurons over extended periods. The mesh electronics maintain stable interfaces with neurons while minimizing tissue damage and inflammatory responses, opening new possibilities for understanding brain function and treating neurological disorders.
