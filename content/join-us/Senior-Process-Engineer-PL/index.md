## Position Summary
The i-BRAIN Nanofabrication Facility is seeking a skilled Photolithography Engineer to lead the operation, maintenance, and process development of mask aligners, maskless aligners (laser writers), and photoresist wet benches. This role is critical in supporting standard-resolution lithography workflows for device prototyping, training users, maintaining high tool uptime, and ensuring reliable patterning across a range of substrates and resists.

## Key Responsibilities
1. Operate and maintain mask aligners (e.g., SUSS MA6) and maskless aligners (e.g., Heidelberg DWL or equivalent laser writers) and optical microscope.
2. Optimize photolithography recipes including soft/hard bake, exposure, development, and alignment strategies.
3. Maintain and operate associated wet benches, including resist coating stations, hotplates, and developers.
4. Perform mask handling, alignment mark calibration, backside alignment, and focus adjustments.
5. Develop lithography processes for a wide range of resists (positive, negative, image reversal).
6. Perform preventive maintenance and coordinate vendor servicing or system upgrades.
7. Write and maintain Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and safety documentation.
8. Train users in photolithography workflows and support device layout translation and pattern transfer.
9. Procure and manage inventory of resists, solvents, masks, substrates, and photolithography accessories.
10. Interface with process teams to support integration into etch, deposition, or bonding flows.

## Required Qualifications
1. Bachelor's degree or higher in Electrical Engineering, Materials Science, Physics, or a related discipline.
2. Minimum of 5 years' hands-on experience operating and maintaining mask aligners or laser writers in a cleanroom setting.
3. Strong understanding of photolithography fundamentals, including resist processing and pattern transfer.
4. Demonstrated ability to write SOPs, technical documentation, and training materials.
5. Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a multidisciplinary and international environment.
6. Fluent in English&Chinese, both written and spoken.

## Preferred Qualifications
1. Master's or Ph.D. in a relevant technical field.
2. Experience with maskless lithography, grayscale writing, or alignment-sensitive applications.
3. Previous work in a university shared facility, semiconductor fab, or national lab setting.
