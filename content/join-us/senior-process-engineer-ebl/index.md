## Position Summary
This role is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and process development of the EBL system and the associated resist spin/coating, development, and cleaning wet benches. The engineer will also support procurement and inventory of specialty materials such as resists, solvents, and substrates critical to high-resolution e-beam patterning.Process Engineers will play a key role in developing robust fabrication processes, maintaining tool performance, ensuring high uptime, writing and updating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and supporting users across a broad range of research and prototyping activities.

## Key Responsibilities
1. Operate, maintain, and develop nanolithography processes on the EBL system.
2. Optimize high-resolution patterning workflows using PMMA, ZEP, HSQ, and other e-beam resists.
3. Maintain and operate associated wet benches, including resist coating, development, and cleaning stations.
4. Calibrate and maintain EBL equipment (beam alignment, stage performance, system stability).
5. Coordinate with vendors for servicing and updates.
6. Procure and manage inventory of chemicals, substrates, and supplies.
7. Write and update SOPs and safety documentation.
8. Train users and assist with e-beam pattern design and dose calibration.
9. Procure and manage inventory of chemicals, resists, substrates, and miscellaneous supplies related to e-beam lithography.

## Required Qualifications
1. Bachelor's degree or higher in Electrical Engineering, Materials Science, Applied Physics, or related field.
2. Hands-on experience in cleanroom environments, with at least five year working directly with high-resolution EBL systems (e.g., Raith, Elionix, JEOL), sub-20 nm features, and multi-layer resist processing
3. Strong documentation and communication skills, especially in writing SOPs and technical reports.
4. Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team.
5. Fluency in English&Chinese and strong communication skills in an international, collaborative environment.

## Preferred Qualifications
1. Master's or Ph.D. in a relevant technical field.
2. Experience with EBL, KrF stepper lithography, or advanced patterning techniques.
3. Previous work in a university shared facility, semiconductor fab, or national lab setting.
