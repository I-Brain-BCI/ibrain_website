## Position Summary
The Charles M. Lieber (CML) group at the Institute of Materials Research (iMR), Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS), is recruiting highly motivated, talented and open-minded postdoctoral researchers.

The CML group is focused on developing transformative brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that blur the distinction between electronics and the brain. The CML group will enable groundbreaking research to understand the brain and brain diseases as well as breakthrough technologies for treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases for the near-term but also enable future advances and treatments that today may be considered the realm of science fiction. Additionally, the CML group will instill a positive and highly interdisciplinary culture in the training of young scientists, engineers and doctors such that they are prepared to lead the development of science and engineering as well as the translation of ideas into commercial technologies that benefit present and future generations!

## Core Responsibilities
1. Conduct independent research under the guidance of the PI of the research group.
2. Independently or collaboratively assist the PI in applying for various research funding programs.
