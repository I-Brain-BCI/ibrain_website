## Position Summary
This role is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and process development of the KrF Stepper and the integrated photoresist coating and development track. Responsibilities span process tuning, stepper calibration, reticle handling, and system troubleshooting. Process Engineers will play a key role in developing robust fabrication processes, maintaining tool performance, ensuring high uptime, writing and updating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and supporting users across a broad range of research and prototyping activities.

## Key Responsibilities
1. Operate and maintain the KrF Stepper (248 nm) and coater/developer track system.
2. Optimize photolithography processes for various resists and substrates.
3. Handle reticle loading, alignment, and CD control.
4. Perform preventive maintenance and work with vendors for calibration and service.
5. Write and maintain SOPs and documentation for all associated processes and tools.
6. Train users on photoresist processing and stepper operation.
7. Coordinate with process teams for lithography integration with etch/deposition steps.
8. Procure and manage inventory of chemicals, resists, substrates, and miscellaneous supplies related to KrF lithography.

## Required Qualifications
1. Bachelor's degree or higher in Electrical Engineering, Materials Science, Applied Physics, or related field.
2. Hands-on experience in cleanroom environments, with at least five year working directly with high-resolution KrF Stepper systems (e.g., ASML), and multi-layer resist processing.
3. Strong documentation and communication skills, especially in writing SOPs and technical reports.
4. Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team.
5. Fluency in English & Chinese and strong communication skills in an international, collaborative environment.

## Preferred Qualifications
1. Master's or Ph.D. in a relevant technical field.
