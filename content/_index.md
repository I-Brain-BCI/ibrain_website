        **Mission.** *i-BRAIN* is developing transformative brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that blur the distinction between electronics and living tissue to produce seamless, noninvasive and fully-stable integration of electronics with the brain to enable groundbreaking research understanding the brain and brain diseases as well as breakthrough technologies for treatment of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. *i-BRAIN* will create solutions for the near-term but also enable future advances and treatments that today may be considered the realm of science fiction.  

        **Benefits to Society:** The research carried out at *i-BRAIN* will create world-leading advances in brain science and neural engineering that enable transformative treatments of some of the most pressing human diseases facing society today, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, depression and aging. *i-BRAIN* will also instill a highly interdisciplinary culture in the training of young scientists, engineers and doctors such that they are prepared to lead the development and translation of science and engineering ideas for the benefit of present and future generations.

        <div style="text-align: left;">
          The main <em>i-BRAIN</em> research facilities and offices are located in 900 square meter of newly renovated space on the 19th floor of SMART building A. The state-of-the-art space includes research facilities and areas for (i) design, software development and data analysis, (ii) characterization of BCIs and integrated circuits, (iii) prototyping and in-vitro measurements, (ii) wet chemistry and biology, (iii) cell and tissue culture, (iv) tissue clearing and histology, (v) isolated clean rodent area for long-term care, surgery and cognitive/behavioral electrophysiology studies, and (vi) high-performance computing. Integral open office spaces provide students through senior researchers with a comfortable working environment and beautiful views of the local Guangming community.

      - title: Disruptive BCI Technology
        content: "Merging the power and scalability of silicon integrated circuits and ultra-flexible minimally-invasive polymer-based electronics for chronic cognitive and motor studies in rodents and nonhuman primates. A central focus is to monitoring and modulate neural activity on a scale heretofore not possible in animal disease models and to translate these advanced neuro-technologies to humans."

      - title: Ideal Brain/Electronics Interfaces
        content: "Develop *ideal* flexible probes that solve key issues facing all technologies today. In simple terms, we are developing BCIs that are stable in recording and stimulation at the level of individual neurons for the life-span of an adult human. The work involves basic research across sciences and engineering, studies in rodents and NHPs and ultimately translation to humans."

      - title: BCIs for Regenerative Medicine
        content: "We are developing 'pro-regenerative' BCIs that not only monitor and/or stimulate neural activity but also promote and control the growth of new neural tissue to repair the brain. The work involves basic research across sciences, engineering and medicine with the goal of translation to human patients for personalized treatment of a range of brain diseases in a way simply not possible today."
